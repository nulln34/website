        i dont know what to talk about but... my life has been shitty. it continues to be shitty. my self-hatred is on the rise. but... i need to survive. if anyone is reading this, you probably found this file from that useless youtube video i posted. i don't like talking about myself. so...
        just survive. <br>        Don't think about it. You wouldn't think about it anyway.
